Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears strictly more than N/2 times in the array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3 
A[] = {1,2,3} 
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Since, each element in 
{1,2,3} appears only once so there 
is no majority element.



def findMajorityElement(arr):
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    for num in arr:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
            count = 1
        elif candidate == num:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1

    # After the first pass, 'candidate' contains a potential majority element

    # Second pass to verify if the 'candidate' is a majority element
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num == candidate:
            count += 1

    if count > len(arr) // 2:
        return candidate
    else:
        return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]
result = findMajorityElement(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 2
